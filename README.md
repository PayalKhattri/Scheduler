# Scheduler Application
During the pandemic, most of the schools and colleges are having classes in hybrid mode i.e. the students have an option to attend classes either in-person or remotely. But the availability of seats is restricted to 50% of the capacity of the classroom. It becomes difficult to follow covid norms if proper scheduling is not done.
 
I have built a Scheduler Application that allows students to submit weekly preferences for attending class in-person or remotely. The tool then assigns available seats to students who want to physically attend class and provides the faculty with a roster of who has been cleared to attend.

I have followed the agile methodology to build my application. Right from designing the prototype to building and deploying my application, I divided everything into sprints of 6 days each which helped me complete the tasks within 3 weeks.
