# Scheduler Application
During the pandemic, most of the schools and colleges are having classes in hybrid mode i.e. the students have an option to attend classes either in-person or remotely. But the availability of seats is restricted to 50% of the capacity of the classroom. It becomes difficult to follow covid norms if proper scheduling is not done.
 
I have built a Scheduler Application that allows students to submit weekly preferences for attending class in-person or remotely. The tool then assigns available seats to students who want to physically attend class and provides the faculty with a roster of who has been cleared to attend.

I have followed the agile methodology to build my application. Right from designing the prototype to building and deploying my application, I divided everything into sprints of 6 days each which helped me complete the tasks within 3 weeks.

### Installation Guide
Make sure you have Node.js installed in your system. If not, download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone [the following](https://github.com/PayalKhattri/Scheduler) repo on your local system.

    git clone https://github.com/Ria700/MSteamsClone.git

First go to your project directory in command line [where is your project located ?]

Then in the next step you have to create jar file for that, this can be done as

mvnw package [for WINDOWS OS ] or ./mvnw package [for MAC OS] , this will create jar file for our application.
    
jar file is created in the target sub-directory

Now go to target sub directory as jar was created inside of it , i.e cd target

Now run the jar file in there. Use command java -jar name.jar [ name is the name of your created jar file.]
